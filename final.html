My final project was a lot of ups and downs. My initial idea was to create a VR headset for my iPhone. To do this I brainstormed a lot of ideas. My first was to connect a trackpad through an input to the phone. That proved to be impossible when it came down to soldering individual pins to other pins. Then I had the idea of using a bluetooth trackpad to control the screen. This is actually doable so this is what I am going to continue to do. I also designed the case for the phone but the 3D printer I wanted to use did not work. So I reprinted it on a less precise 3D printer. Even though this class is over I am still going to continue trying to make my final project actually work.
