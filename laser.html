I did a lot with laser cutting. We started out by making a box that fits together like puzzle pieces. On top of the box I rastered an image. Then a second thing I did with the laser cutter was cut an image into a water bottle. To do this I used a rotary attachment to rotate the water bottle to make the image actually cut. The third thing I did was cut out a stamp. We took rubber and then cut around an image we wanted. The last thing I did was created a living hinge. This took many takes and different materials. At first <a href="../randazzoj">Joey</a> and I used wood, which wasn't cut all the way through. Then after 3 seperate attempts I made a living hinge using cardboard.
