This project was pretty straight forward. I just had to create a design on photoshop and then things got kinda tricky. After making the final design I had to open it up in corel. Then I needed to trace the outline of my image and put a special line around it. This line allowed for my image to be cut. Then after I had finished I exported the image as an EPS and pulled it up on Roland Versa Works and adjusted the sizing and printed out 40 stickers.
