In this project we were supposed to make a 3D print of our own heads. To do this <a href="../ellise">Ethan</a> and <a href="../franquesam">Marc</a> scanned my head. After that I emailed the file to myself from the tablet that took the scan. Then I had to fix some of the holes in the Meshmixer software and then export it to Makerbot software. I had to switch it to Makerbot software because the printers we have are Makerbots. Then I printed it. However I messed up quite badly resulting in probably the worlds smallest bust. I would show a picture but I lost it. Then I scaled up the image and reprinted it. It took about 4 hour to print.
