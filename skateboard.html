For this project we glued together 7 pieces of thin wood to make our own skateboards. First we sanded to make sure when we glued they would be flat. Then I rastered an image onto my board. Then in the span of 8 minutes Joey and I had to glue together the wood put them on the mold and vacuum seal them together. My skateboard did not come out perfectly. The sides were not lined up correcctly so I had to sand down a lot on the front and back.

Since CTIC is closed I dont have any images.
