In the project our group was supposed to build the tallest tower we could using only uncooked spaghetti, tape, string and a marshmallow. The only rules were that the marshmello had to be on the top of the tower and that the tower couldn't be secured to the table. We tried to make our tower have a sturdy base by making it a triangle. However when building up higher and higher the structure became very flimsy. To fix that we added increasingly smaller triangles to help secure it. These didn't work though and it caused the tower to fall. We kept using more and more tape to try and secure the tower, but the tape wouldn't stick to the spaghetti well. We ended up not using the string at all because we did not see the point in it. If I was to redo this project I would make the base a cube and buile from the cube into a pyramid to keep the rigid structure.
